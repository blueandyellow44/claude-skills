"""check_deps.py - production dependency advisories, with reachability triage.

  check_deps.py REPO [--audit-json FILE]   (--audit-json: parse a saved `npm audit --json`, for tests)

Per package folder with a lockfile (root plus workspaces, never node_modules):
  - deps.lockfile.<dir>: a package.json with no lockfile FAILs (each install
    resolves different versions). Inside a git repo a lockfile counts only when
    git would ship it: one that exists on disk but is git-ignored FAILs, since
    CI and production never see it. A workspace member (a folder matched by the
    root package.json `workspaces` globs or pnpm-workspace.yaml `packages`) is
    locked by the root lockfile and PASSes naming it; its audit is the root's.
  - deps.audit.<dir>.<package>: one result per high or critical production
    advisory. FAIL unless security/advisory-triage.json records it as not
    reachable with a reason and a review date, which makes it PASS with that
    reasoning shown. Reachable or untriaged stays FAIL. A parent flagged only
    through a child (npm lists the child's name in `via`) carries the child's
    advisories: triaged unreachable there means PASS here, untriaged means FAIL
    naming the child.
  - deps.audit.<dir>.moderate: moderate and low advisories, one result.
Reports: npm 7+ (per-package map), pnpm and npm 6 (advisories keyed by id) and
yarn classic (`yarn audit --json`, one JSON object per line) are all read; a
yarn line whose resolution is dev-only is left out, as --omit=dev would.
A major-version fix is named as such; nothing is ever installed or bumped.
npm missing, offline, or an unparseable audit: UNKNOWN with the reason.
