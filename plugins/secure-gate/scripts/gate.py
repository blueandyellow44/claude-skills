"""gate.py - turn a secure-launch ledger into a ship / do-not-ship decision.

  gate.py LEDGER [--repo R] [--tests-from security/gate.json] [--max-age-hours N]

Refuses (exit 1) on any FAIL and on any UNKNOWN, unless that exact check id is
listed in R/security/accepted.json with a reason and a ruling date. Accepted
items are still printed. An empty ledger refuses: nothing measured is not a
pass, and a passing test command never stands in for a scan. A malformed or
internally inconsistent ledger is exit 2: counts that do not match the
results, a repo field that is missing or relative (a ledger that does not
name the absolute checkout it judged is not bound to this one), no git
binding while R is a git repo, a binding to another commit or working tree,
a generated_at with no time zone or more than five minutes in the future.

--tests-from: a JSON file {"test_command": "npm run test:api"} naming the
repo's mutation-proven security tests. The command runs after the ledger is
found usable and non-empty; a failure refuses. A missing file becomes UNKNOWN
gate.tests (refused unless accepted).

What the gate cannot see: a well-formed, fresh ledger whose rows were edited
with the counts recomputed. The ledger carries no signature, so the control
for that is CI writing the ledger in-job, outside the checkout (the
templates do), never trusting one found in the tree.

In GitHub Actions it writes ::error / ::warning annotations and a step summary.
